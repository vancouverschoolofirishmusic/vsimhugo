title: Update

Thank you to everyone who responded to our survey over the summer.
Based on the results we are planning to run a pilot series of classes in the New Year. 
We are inquiring with schools in East Van (via the Vancouver School Board) to arrange a suitable venue. 
The details will be worked out once we have secured the venue, but will involve a group of children in the 6-10 age range, all on the tin whistle, once a week (weekday evening) for 4-6 weeks.
We will send out a newsletter email and social media posts once the classes are confirmed, likely November.
