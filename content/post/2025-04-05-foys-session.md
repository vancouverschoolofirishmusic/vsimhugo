Looking for live traditional Irish music in Vancouver? Join us at our regular session at [Foy's Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NbQbxd84LJ1zjsKr7), where musicians gather to share tunes and great company.

We meet every Sunday from 6-9 pm, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming - whether you're an experienced player, a beginner, or just a lover of Irish music, you'll feel right at home.

Harmonic and rhythmic accompaniment is by special invitation only. If you’d like to know why we made this decision, you’re welcome to come into Foy’s on a Sunday evening and chat with us over a pint.

Check out full details of our session, including times and format, on [thesession.org](https://thesession.org/sessions/9105).
