We would like to spread the word about an exciting cultural event organised by oir friends in Portland, Oregon - the [Sean-nós Northwest Festival](https://www.seannos.org/snnw-registration)!

The festival runs from May 1st to 4th and features [workshops and performances](https://www.seannos.org/snnw-schedule) of sean-nós singing and dancing, Irish music and the Irish language. 

This is a great opportunity to learn from master teachers and performers in a friendly, social setting. 

Beidh neart Gaeilgoirí ann chun na Gaeilge a chleachtadh idir tosaitheoirí agus cainteoirí líofa. 
Gaeilge agus fáilte!
