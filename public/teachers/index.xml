He learned classical violin as a child, before discovering traditional Irish music in his teens. He learned his first Irish tunes to play for dancers in Shannon, a small town north of Quebec City with strong Irish heritage. During his university years studying geology in Montreal, he was part of the city&amp;rsquo;s vibrant traditional music scene, and played sessions, gigs, festivals and feisanna. While living in St. John&amp;rsquo;s, Newfoundland, Dave recorded a duet album with accordion player Graham Wells, one of Newfoundland&amp;rsquo;s finest musicians. Dave has been living in Vancouver since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
